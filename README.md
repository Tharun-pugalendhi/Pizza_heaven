Pizza Heaven is a dynamic and interactive website built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices. 
With clean and organized code, I implemented various JavaScript functionalities, such as interactive elements, to enhance the user experience. 
This project showcases my skills in front-end development, demonstrating an ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites from scratch.
